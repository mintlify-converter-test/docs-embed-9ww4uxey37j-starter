Embedly's `platform.js` ships with a lightweight version of [Player.js](/docs/playerjs)
 to make it easy to interact with Cards and Embedly Iframes. Instead of having to include multiple libraries and this makes it simple to interact with the media.

<Info>

## Make sure platform.js is installed!

Intergrations require platform.js to be installed on the page, you can learn how to install it [here](/docs/playerjs)


</Info>

## Quick Start

It's a rather simple integration. It looks like this:

```javascript javascript
embedly('player', function(player){
  console.log(player.url) // URL of the media that we are operating on.

  // When the user pauses a video, perform an action.
  player.on('pause', function(){
    //display modal.
  });

  // Autoplay all the videos that support Player.js
  player.play()
});

```

The player callback is only called if the Card or iframe supports player.js and is ready to accept calls. if supports the following methods

## Demo

Here's a quick demo of using the player method to control both a Card and a Media Iframe.

  console.log('Paused: '+paused);
});

```

**`player.mute()`**: void  
Mute the media

**`player.unmute()`**: void

**`player.getMuted(callback)`**: boolean  
Determine if the media is muted

``` 
player.getMuted(function(muted){
  console.log('Muted: '+muted);
});

```

**`player.setVolume(volume)`**: void  
Set the volume. Value needs to be between 0-100

``` 
player.setVolume(50);

```

**`player.getVolume(callback)`**: number  
Get the volume. Value will be between 0-100

``` 
player.getVolume(function(volume){
  console.log('Volume: '+volume);
});

```

**`player.getDuration(callback)`**: number

**`player.setLoop(bool)`**: boolean  
Tell the media to loop continuously

```

```

**`player.getLoop(callback)`**: number  
Return the loop attribute of the video

``` 
player.getLoop(function(looped){

});

```

## Events

**`timeupdate`**

``` 
player.on('timeupdate', function(data){
  // autoplay the video.

  console.log('Current Time: '+ data.seconds);
});

```
