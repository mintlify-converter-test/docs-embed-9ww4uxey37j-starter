The Embed Button allows you to allow users to embed your site's content with a  
single click. Get more impressions from all over the web. To create a Button  
for your site visit the [Button Generator](http://embed.ly/button)
.

<Warning>

## platform.js is required.

In order to use the button you first need to install `platform.js`. Please see the install instructions [platform.js](/docs/platformjs)


</Warning>

By default `platform.js` will create a button for an `A` tag with the class `embedly-button`. For example, this will create a button:

```html html
<a class="embedly-button" href="http://embed.ly/code">Embed</a>

```

If you would like to specify a URL to embed, you can use the `data-url` property like so:

```html html
<a class="embedly-button" data-url="http://apple.com"
		href="http://embed.ly/code">Embed</a>

```

## Customize

There are a number of `data-*` attributes that you can use to customize the button. They are as follows:

| Attribute | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data-url | URL i.e [http://embed.ly](http://embed.ly) | Specifies the URL to embed, by default it uses the URL of the page it is placed on |
| data-theme | "round", "flat", "light-round", "light-flat" | Sets the look of the button. The default it "round" |
| data-lang | "en", "de", "tr", "es" | The language of the Embed button, by default we use the browser's locale. |
| data-target | "window" (defaults to modal) | Opens the embed dialog in a new window instead of a modal. |

## JavaScript

With `Platform.js` allows you to control buttons programatically. For instance to use a different class name for the button you can use the the following code:

```javascript javascript
embedly('button', 'embed-this');

```

If you would like to create a button from a single element you can do the following:

```javascript javascript
var a = document.getElementById('#myCard');
embedly('button', a, {
  target: 'window'
});

```

If `platform.js` has not loaded yet, it will queue actions till we are ready to act on them.

## Modal

## Modal

If you would like to manually trigger the Embed Modal you can do this via the  
following javascript:

```javascript javascript
embedly('modal', 'http://embed.ly');

```

This will bring up a modal in which the user can choose to copy the Embed code.  
If you wish to open the dialog in a new window instead, you may use the  
following code:

```javascript javascript
embedly('modal', {
  url: 'http://embed.ly',
  target: 'window'
});

```
