Watch out! You are headed down the road into developer territory! APIs in general are designed for developers. If you're not a developer we welcome you to poke around. It may take you a little bit to get the hang of things, but don't give up, we know you can do it.

**Embedly makes it easy to display, control and measure third party content in your application or website.
