## What is Embedly?

Embedly is a set of front-end tools that help web and app developers  
create better user experiences. We believe the best tools are simple,  
easy to use, and perfectly suited to their task. You’ll find that  
embodied in Embed, Extract, and Display—tools that provide ultra-fast  
ways to present richer content more effectively.

## Why Embedly?

Because it's the easiest way to present rich content and create user experiences.  
In less then 10 minutes, you can embed content from hundreds of providers and  
generate rich previews for any URL on the web.

Here's a quote from James Patterson, the Platform Lead at Yammer:

If we weren't using Embedly we'd have had to spend probably around a week of  
an engineer's time to build something that gets the basic job done. It  
wouldn't be nearly as good, we'd have to deal with constant bug fixes and  
we'd be paying Amazon $200-$300 a month to host it anyway. Using Embedly is  
a no-brainer.

See our [Customers](http://embed.ly/customers)
 page for more testimonials.

We take care of every step of the process: retrieving information  
about a URL, checking it against malware registries, extracting content,  
making additional API calls to providers that support them, parsing RSS  
feeds, and performing validation. We save you time so that you can focus  
on making your app great.

## Am I paying for content?

No, you're paying for the use of Embedly's processing engine. You're  
responsible for any copyright implications that may come from embedding  
third-party content in your site or app.

## How fast is Embedly?

Fast. Embedly uses several techniques to accelerate the embedding process:

*   **Caching**: The first time we see a URL, we store its contents in our  
    cache so that repeated requests can be processed immediately. We invalidate  
    the cache at least once every 12-24 hours.
*   **Parallel processing**: Once we've resolved the initial URL, we perform  
    the API calls, image parsing, and malware detection in parallel.
*   **Batch processing**: Send up to 10 URLs at a time to Embedly, and we'll  
    process them all in parallel.

## Where can I find a demo of Embedly in action?

 have been building.

## Do you support Facebook / Instagram content?

On October 24, 2020 Facebook and Instagram's OEmbed APIs were migrated to require authentication and were moved behind the facebook Graph API, rather than being publicly available.

Initially we modified our API to handle this change, however since implementing this new framework, we have seen consistent issues with upstream rate-limiting and problems accessing content which was previously supported by Embed.ly, leading to missing or invalid embed content.

We recommend that you begin to explore alternatives for embedding facebook and instagram posts directly from their API if this is a priority for your application.

We understand that embedded content from these providers is desirable to many of our clients, however we can only offer a service that's as good as the upstream provider is willing to extend to our APIs.

## Do you have a list of IP addresses we can use to identify your traffic?

Yes
