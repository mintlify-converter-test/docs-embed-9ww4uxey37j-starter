## Need an API Key?

No problem! Sign up for one at [app.embed.ly](https://app.embed.ly/signup)


</Check>

To authenticate your requests, include `key` as a query parameter, it should look like this::

`https://api.embedly.com/:version/:endpoint?key=:key&<additional query parameters>`

Choose `:version` and `:endpoint` depending on the part of the API that you want to access, e.g. `1/oembed` for the [/1/oembed](/docs/oembed)
 or `1/extract` for the [/1/extract](/docs/extract)
. Replace `:key` with the unique API key shown in [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly)
..

## Restricting Access

By default, Embedly allows requests from anywhere. Tighter security is also an option. You can use the **API > Key** section of [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly)
 to create a whitelist of referrers and/or IP addresses that Embedly will accept requests from. All other requests will be rejected with a `403 Forbidden` response.

We use a simple "globbing" syntax for referrers, where `*` is a wildcard that will match any number of characters. To allow all traffic from `yourdomain.com` (but not its subdomains), you would enter `yourdomain.com*`. To allow subdomains as well, you would make it `*yourdomain.com*`. Take note of the wildcard at the end, which means that requests that indicate a path as well as a host (e.g. `yourdomain.com/foo`) will be accepted.

Globbing works similarly for IP addresses. If all of your requests come from a cluster of servers with IP addresses in the range `1.1.1.1` to `1.1.1.255`, then you would set a single rule `1.1.1.*`.

## OAuth

Two-legged OAuth is supported as an alternative to key-based authentication.

Your account can only be configured to use either key-based authentication or OAuth, not both. To switch from one form of authentication to the other, visit the **API > Key** section of [the app dashboard](https://app.embed.ly)
.
