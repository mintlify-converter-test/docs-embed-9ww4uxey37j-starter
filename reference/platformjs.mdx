`plaform.js` is Embedly's JavaScript library for creating cards, buttons, modals and interacting with the player apis.

## Install

There are multiple ways to install `platform.js` into your page, here is the preferred method. Copy and paste the following code to the `<body>` of your document.

```html html
<script>
  (function(w, d){
   var id='embedly-platform', n = 'script';
   if (!d.getElementById(id)){
     w.embedly = w.embedly || function() {(w.embedly.q = w.embedly.q || []).push(arguments);};
     var e = d.createElement(n); e.id = id; e.async=1;
     e.src = ('https:' === document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js';
     var s = d.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];
     s.parentNode.insertBefore(e, s);
   }
  })(window, document);
</script>

```

This allows embedly to install `platform.js` javascript in an async manner, but still queue requests immediately.

If you will not be integrating the the `embedly` global object then you can also use:

```html html
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

```
